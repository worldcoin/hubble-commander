# ðŸŽ„ State trees

## Account tree

![Account tree](account_tree.png)

Used for storage of public keys. The root of the tree is stored in the AccountRegistry smart contract. New accounts can be inserted individually or in batches of 16 pubkeys.

## User state tree

![User state tree](user_state_tree.png)

Stores the account state at a point in time. The root of this tree is included in each commitment to represent the state after the transactions in commitment were applied.

This struct is used to store the account tree, only the leaf nodes have the `Data` populated.

Data is defined by the `[UserState](https://github.com/thehubbleproject/hubble-contracts/blob/7b75d55d603b20763dd5b0a3cab2242a84352e75/contracts/libs/Types.sol#L196)` struct

```go
struct UserState {
      uint256 pubkeyID;
      uint256 tokenID;
      uint256 balance;
      uint256 nonce;
  }
```

The accounts are created when the initial deposit is finalized: [https://github.com/thehubbleproject/hubble-commander/blob/c60f42747e633dae53afd202e91550604667be66/db/deposit.go#L73](https://github.com/thehubbleproject/hubble-commander/blob/c60f42747e633dae53afd202e91550604667be66/db/deposit.go#L73).

The deposit data is saved in the `DepositQueued` log [https://github.com/thehubbleproject/hubble-contracts/blob/7b75d55d603b20763dd5b0a3cab2242a84352e75/contracts/DepositManager.sol#L10](https://github.com/thehubbleproject/hubble-contracts/blob/7b75d55d603b20763dd5b0a3cab2242a84352e75/contracts/DepositManager.sol#L10)
